    <p>Description

        Lasagne has been a favorite of mine since way back when, when my mother made it.
        It is so good.
    </p>

    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
        
        1 small onion, chopped
        
        1 carrot, chopped
        
        1 shallot, minced
        
        3 ½ ounces prosciutto, chopped
        
        11 ounces ground pork
        
        11 ounces ground beef
        
        1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
        
        ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
        
        salt to taste
        
        6 fluid ounces red wine
        
        21 ounces peeled San Marzano tomatoes
        White Sauce:
        
        6 tablespoons butter
        
        ⅔ cup all-purpose flour
        
        3 ¼ cups milk
        
        ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
        
        salt and ground black pepper to taste
        Lasagna Layers:
        
        11 ounces lasagna noodles
        
        2 ½ cups grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste
    </ul>

    <ol>
    Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion, carrot, shallot, and prosciutto until onion is
    translucent and prosciutto releases some fat, about 10 minutes. Add pork and beef; season with 1 teaspoon nutmeg,
    cinnamon, and salt to taste. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes.
    
    Pour red wine over meat mixture; increase heat and cook until wine evaporates, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes and mix
    well; bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes break down and flavors of
    Bolognese sauce have combined, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
    
    Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat; add flour. Whisk vigorously until mixture is smooth. Pour in milk and
    cook, stirring occasionally, over medium heat until white sauce thickens enough to cover the back of a spoon, about 10
    minutes; season with 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, salt, and pepper.
        
    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally
    until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and run under cold water to stop the cooking process. Lay
    noodles on a clean towel and pat dry.
        
    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
    
    Pour a ladleful of Bolognese sauce and a ladleful of white sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish; top with 3
    or 4 lasagna noodles. Cover noodles with 1/3 of the white sauce and 1/3 of the Bolognese sauce. Sprinkle some of the
    Parmesan cheese on top; cover with lasagna noodles. Repeat layers, ending with white sauce and Parmesan cheese.
    
    Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and top is golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Let stand 3 to 4 minutes before
    slicing.</ol>
